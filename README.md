# ENGSCI263-CM-Project

# Nitrate Leaching
This project was made to model the concentration of nitrate in the Southland aquifers. We calibrated our model to fit the data as closely as possible and then accounted for the uncertainty in the parameters. We then made predictions of the future using different combinations of sets of parameters.

# Recommendation
Based on the predicitions made, we make a recommendation on whether an active carbon sink should continue to be used or if the managed aquifer recharge should be implemented instead.
