## Project Summary
This project contains the code that models nitrate concentrations within the Edendale aquifer. The model is to aid Environment Southland in the resource consent of Dairy NZ's demonstration farm. Key aspects of this project include quantifying the effects of an active carbon sink and the potentional impacts of a managed aquifer recharge program.

## Technologies
This project is written in Python 3.7.4 and uses the following libraries.
* os
* numpy
* scipy.optimize and scipy stats
* matlibplot

# Installation
* main script - main.py
* model implementation - mode_functions.py
* test suites - testing_functions.py
* data - nl.cows.txt, nl_n.csv

## Set up
To run this project first download the repository and open in Visual Studio Code or similar. To generate all relevant modelling output run the 'main.py' script.
